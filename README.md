# FIFA2014_World_Cup_Heights

**Project Domain**: Sports

**Tools used**: Python and Tableau

**Type of Algorithms used**: LinearRegression and Polynomial Regression

**Project details**: Dashboards created to show the functionalities of Tableau to my students in my Data Analytics class. 
  
1. Dashboard Number One (2014: Data Analysis) shows various visualizations that (Bar Chart, Histogram, Scatter Plot, TreeMap and a BoxPlot).
2. Dashboard Number Two (2014: Data Analytics) compares the results of using different methods (average Body Mass Index, Linear Regression and Polynomial Regression) to predict height.

**Programming Languages**: Python

**Project learning**:

1. Researched about correlation between Height an various factors (Weight, Continent, Position, Age, etc).
2. Created various models to calculate/predict Height:
   - Calculation using average Body Mass Index from the Dataset.
   - LinearRegression.
   - PolynomialRegression.
4. Determined that the Polynomial model has the best performance.
